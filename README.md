This program is for getting an approximation of the value of T^(N/R).
Here, T is a positive integer, and N and R are integers denoting the numerator and denominator of the exponent, respectively.

To use this program:

1. Run the program
2. On the first line, input the value of T.
3. On the second line, input N and R, separated by a space.
4. On the third line, input a positive integer number of iterations. Increasing this number will increase the accuracy of the result.
5. On the fourth line, input a positive integer number of decimal digits in the result.
